# Task Overview

You are presented with a FastAPI-based inventory service that utilizes OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens to protect critical endpoints. Following a backend refactor, all authentication and token-based access are broken: users cannot retrieve tokens from the login endpoint or use tokens for authenticated routes. The issue is silent in logs, pointing to logic or dependency problems in the authentication flow. Your objective is to identify and resolve why login attempts and protected endpoint access return 401 Unauthorized, and restore full authentication functionality.

# Guidance
- Review the authentication and user verification logic, ensuring dependencies and token handling are correct and compatible with the OAuth2 flow.
- Explore the user data model, the password checking mechanism, and token creation/validation routines for subtle mismatches or misconfigurations.
- Double-check that endpoints granting and consuming access tokens are integrated with the authentication logic as expected.
- Validate that the OAuth2 password flow is implemented according to FastAPI standards, and that token payloads and user lookups function as designed.

# Objectives
- Resolve the authentication bug preventing successful login and access to protected endpoints.
- Ensure valid user credentials result in issuance of a working JWT access token.
- Enable authenticated users to access their profile endpoint, returning correct user details using a valid token.

# How to Verify
- Attempt to log in via the authentication endpoint with valid user credentials; expect to receive a JWT access token in response.
- Use the received access token to authenticate requests to the protected user profile endpoint and confirm it returns user information successfully.
- Confirm that authentication fails as expected for invalid users or tokens, while succeeding for proper credentials and valid tokens.
